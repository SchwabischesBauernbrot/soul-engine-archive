# Welcome to SocialAGI!

SocialAGI is "The library for AI Souls." Our mission is to provide developers with a comprehensive and user-friendly resource to build and design Social Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems, better known as AI Souls.

AI Souls are software entities capable of independent thought, capable of interacting with the world and people in a social context, forming complex mental models, and following human-like directives. With SocialAGI, you have access to a toolset for creating and fine-tuning such entities to integrate within your applications.

## Core Features

**AI Souls**: At the heart of SocialAGI is the AI Soul, a malleable entity you can shape to your requirements. It can be molded to interact with users, adapt to different situations, and form its unique understanding of the world.

**Mental Models**: SocialAGI introduces Mental Models that serve as the knowledge base for your AI Souls. They learn, adapt, and evolve as the AI Soul interacts with the world, making your AI Soul more context-aware and intelligent.

**Directives**: Directives are high-level instructions that guide the behaviour of your AI Souls. With directives, you can imbue your AI Soul with goals, rules, and behavioural guidelines.
